# Heatmap-app

This application provides a very simple (and not very pretty) graphical interface for using the seasketch/heatmap tool <https://github.com/seasketch/heatmap>.

Before launching the application for the first time you'll probably need to make it executable by running the following terminal command in this directory:

`chmod +x heatmap-app`

After that you should be able to launch the app by double clicking.

Docker desktop will need to be running to generate heatmaps.
